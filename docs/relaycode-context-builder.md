current ai agent code editor like cursor is slow for completing task, too many network calls, too many spaggeti code, hallucinations...because they use advanced models but with too many system context prompt lenght that exceed model capability.

example, gemini pro 2.5 is very good at coding within 30.000 max context window

so

`relaycode context builder` app try to fix that problem with combinations of apis from repomix and relaycode api. and the ux is so cohesive than `repoprompt context builder`

the workflow from what I think is

- intelligent context: determine which llm models to use with how many context window max size for most effective and efficient reasoning
	- effective llm context window
		- presets
		- manual create
- context builder
	- context presets
		- default: codemap
		- create
			- llm
			- manual
				- add ignore files


so now, what would the most cohesive UX look life of  `relaycode context builder`??? give me single html with css file.
